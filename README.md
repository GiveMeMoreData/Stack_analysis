# Stack_analysis  
Unfortunatelly this project is with full polish commentary.  
The final part of the project was a 10 min public presentation of found resoults. 
###The finall file to look at is presentation in pdf and Rshiny applications located in two directories.  

On this project I worked on with my colleague. We were supposed to choose at least 3 data sets with one beeing at least 100 MB and show any intresting things connected with it.  In directories can be found the filles that were effect of analysis done in .R files. It's used by Rshiny for presenting resoults. 

We agreed on doing two things.  

## Tag analysis in Rshiny
### files: Taganalysis.R
This is one of the simplests things that you can do with this datasets,   
but at the same time it's still very interesting and can show very intresting properties of chosen stack. 


## Lookout for a good criteria for finding experts on a stack forum
### files: Students.R, Experts.R
This is more important part of the project and many intresting ideas (that are not mentioned in presentation) can be found in .R files. First we were looking for a good linear correlation between the vaues that we thought that cound be connected with expertse. 
What we fast understood was that Spearman's correlation whas the better pick and it describes resoults more accurately. 
At the end we also wantet to show examples of people gained significant experience 

If you still have soem question, I recommend looking into presentation and and the into the .R filess,  
other than that feel free to leave a issue.
