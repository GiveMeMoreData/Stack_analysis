# Stack_analysis  
Unfortunatelly this project's commentary is fully done in polish.  

## Project Description
This project was done in pairs. We were supposed to choose at least 3 data sets with one being at least 100 MB and show any intresting phenomena connected with it. Directories containe files that were effect of analysis done in R. They are used by Rshiny for presenting resoults.  

### the resoults can be found in Presentation_final.pdf and in Rshiny web apps  


We focused on two problems.  

## Tag analysis in Rshiny
### files: Taganalysis.R
This is one of the simplests things that you can do with this datasets,   
but at the same time it's still very interesting and can show very intresting properties of chosen stack. 


## Succesful method of finding experts on stack forum
### files: Students.R, Experts.R
This is more important part of the project and many intresting ideas (that are not mentioned in presentation) can be found in .R files. First we were looking for a good linear correlation between the vaues that we thought that cound be connected with expertse. 
What we quicly understood was that Spearman's correlation was bettre methon and it describes resoults more accurately. 
At the end we also show examples of people who gained significant experience

If you still have soem question, I recommend looking into presentation and and the into the .R filess,  
other than that feel free to leave a issue.
